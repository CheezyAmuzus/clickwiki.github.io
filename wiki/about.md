# What's this? 
ClickWiki is a community-driven Wiki all about [Clickteam](/clickteam) We'll cover their [products](/clickteam/history), [exporters](/exporters), [extensions](/extensions), and even more with in-depth information. Our aim with the Wiki is to provide **fully documented pages** that make finding **answers simple to find**. We strike for **detail** to enable you to **discover more possibilities** for Fusion and your projects. We will keep the Wiki alive as long as possible with periodic updates and will be as **transparent as possible** with our operations.

The Wiki acts as a bridge between the help documentation, and a central source for tips and tricks and frequently asked solutions buried in the [Community Forums](/clickteam/forums).


## Inspired by our "spiritual" predecessor.
During 2010-2012, there was an official encyclopedia for Clickteam named **FusionWiki**. However, due to an unforeseen update failure, the Wiki was taken offline permanently and had lost **all** of its content. That can't happen again!


## We're not the first.
This Wiki isn't the first to create and write up about Clickteam's products and features. Other Wikis do exist but may be in other languages, for specific communities or for different purposes. Coincidentally, the name "ClickWiki" was used from around 2007-2008 referring to another vanished Wiki, but this won't be referring to this one.

You can think of this Wiki as the spiritual successor. It's completely new, kickstarted by different clickers and aims to preserve the knowledge and hours poured to build it.

You may have read about us in [Fused](/fused)!.

### **What if you go offline unexpectedly?**


In event that a temporary outage caused the Wiki to go offline, be rest assured we'd like to get it back up and running **as quickly as possible**. In case something disastrous happens, our remote and local backups will allow us to revert back to normal operations.

If, in the **unlikely** event the Wiki can no longer be hosted or properly maintained, the repository will be transferred to somebody else to keep on going.
